This is a variation on the game of Risk that I created. 
Because I wanted to add variety to the game, Each player does not recieve the same number of territories to start.
However, Every player recieves the same number of starting troops, 30. This makes it that if a person recieves 1
territory, he will be able to place all 30 troops in that territory. While this is extremely unlikely, less extreme
versions of this game give variety to the game that I thought it lacked.
